## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.5] - 2021-06-10
## Added
- export_simulink_loss_model using new functions to search transistor elements (incl. fix #17)

### Removed
- export_simulink_v1 (outdated)


## [0.2.4] - 2021-05-28
### Added
- #13: GeckoCircuits Exporter exports mirrowed conducting characterisitc for negative currents
### Bugfixes

## [0.2.3] - 2021-05-21
### Added
- Simple calculation method for mosfet gate resistor (Paper PCIM 2006: D.Kübrich 'Invetsigation of Turn-Off Behaviour under the Assumption of Linear Capacitances')
### Bugfix
- bug #7: was not fully fixed. Fixed now. 
- bug #9: in case of no err-data, fill working point with object instead of list

## [0.2.2] - 2021-05-11
### Added
- print_TDB() returns a list with transistor names 
- add some CREE power module housing types

### Bugfix
- fix #6: Avoid KeyError when using devices without err-losscurves
- fix #7: wrong fill of wp.xxx_r_channel/xxx_v_channel when using transistor.update_wp() or transistor.quickstart_wp()

## [0.2.1] - 2021-05-06
### Bugfix
- Problem when reading .csv-files generated by english-language systems

## [0.2.0] - 2021-05-04
### Added
- Example template to generate a transistor object
- transistor method: linearize_switch_ui_graph
- transistor.switch methods: print_all_channel_data, print_channel_data_vge, print_channel_data_temp
- New class LinearizedModel: Contains data for a linearized Switch/Diode depending on given operating point.
- New class to store c_iss, c_oss, c_rss in Transistor.
- New Transistor attribute: e_coss
- Documentation drawing
- Exporter: GeckoCIRCUITS
- calc_object_i_e to calculate loss loss curves for other gate resistors/voltage levels
- New class 'wp' to store local calculation parameters to use in your program
- automatically fill 'wp' objects when using functions like find_approx_wp()
- added a quick start to fill in 'wp' values quick and easy
- New housing types
- .json exporter

### Removed
- Removed Metadata class. Added its attributes to Transistor class instead
### Changed
- Restructured foster thermal model argument handover
- Rename package to transistordatabase (instead of transistor_database) due to pip package rules
- csv2array callable with options
- move some functionality out of transistor class (tdb.Transistor. -> tdb.)

## [0.1.0] - 2021-02-04
### Added
- Construct a Transistor-object and save relevant data in its attributes and subclasses
- Class structure documented in a class UML diagram
- Save Transistor-object in an object database created with mongodb
- Mandatory attributes and restricted types/values to guarantee only valid and functional Transistors can be added to
  the database
- Matlab-Exporter
